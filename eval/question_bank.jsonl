# Eval question bank: Slack + code queries live in servers-archived

Queries about Slack conversations and code updates (probes, manifests, explainability diff, artifact_viewer, list_runs, etc.) are maintained in **servers-archived**:

- **servers-archived/eval_queries_slack_and_code.jsonl** – full question set (inferable + underdetermined) with artifact pointers and reference answers.

Use that file for grading LLMs on artifact-based answers. This repo (CognitivePaperLab) holds the run artifacts and analysis code; the canonical eval queries for that workflow live in servers-archived.
